# ðŸŽ² roll.nvim

**roll.nvim:** A fun and challenging game for Neovim.

It's like a box of chocolates, but with a sarcastic twist: you never know what you're going to get, and you're stuck with it.

The rules are simple:

- You're given a random colorscheme.
- You can't change the colorscheme.
- You can't restart Neovim.

That means you're stuck with whatever random colorscheme you're given, even if it's something that would make a toddler cry. If you break any of the rules, you lose.

Challenge your friends to play and see who can last the longest. But be warned: the odds are not in your favor.

Roll your luck, and have fun! ðŸŽ²
